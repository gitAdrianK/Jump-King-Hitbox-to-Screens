# Jump-King-Hitbox-to-Screens
Hitbox2Screens is a basic tool built initially for python but adapted for C# which takes custom hitboxes for jump king and turns them into individual screens that can be used to help with texturing

[Download the program here](https://github.com/gitAdrianK/Jump-King-Hitbox-to-Screens/releases)

## Usage:
1: Have the executable in the same folder as your "level.png" or "visual_level.png"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;->If you don't have a level.png or visual_level.png use [this XNB tool](https://github.com/LeonBlade/xnbcli/releases/tag/v1.0.7) to export the games xnb file

2: Run the exectuable, this will generate all 169 screens as individual PNGs to be used

## Troubleshooting:
1: Will not work inside a folder that contains "#" at any point in the path name

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution: Move your "level.png" or "visual_level.png" file to a different directory

2: Will not work if inside a folder such as onenote that is not a drive device on the computer

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution: Use C: or D: etc.
